    description: The original Shadwell station was on the East London Line, and a DLR station joined it
        when the DLR opened in 1987. The East London Line closed in 2007 and reopened in 2010 as the
        Overground, with a completely refurbished station and a new station entrace facing the DLR.
    model_notes: While these are technically two separate stations, they're often marked as an interchange
        and share the same name, so they are modelled together.
