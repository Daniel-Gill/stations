    description: West Silvertown was built as part of the King George V extension to the DLR, which opened
        in November 2005. There were plans for a station between here and Canning Town, but they
        were placed on hold and the extension built without it, making that stretch of track one of the
        longest gaps between stations on the DLR (and the longest one without a tunnel).
