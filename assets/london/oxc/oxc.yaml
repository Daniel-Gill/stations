    description: The large ticket hall at this station was only added in the late 1960s, when the Victoria
        Line was built - before that, there were far fewer entrances. It was built by constructing
        a supporting frame under the road and then hollowing out the soil, all while traffic continued
        to run above.
    model_notes: The passageways between the two sets of lines here were modelled on foot, so may be slightly wrong.
