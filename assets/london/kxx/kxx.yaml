    description: King's Cross St. Pancras has less platforms than Bank/Monument but serves two mainline stations,
        and so is significantly busier. It was also the location of the King's Cross fire in 1987, which killed
        31 people and led to the removal of wooden escalators from the Underground as well as the banning
        of smoking on the system - two factors which contributed to the deadly blaze.
    model_notes: This is a tricky one, and done mostly from memory and a cutaway picture I was able to find.
        The exits may well be a little off, and Pentonville Road is missing completely.
