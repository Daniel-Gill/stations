    description: The northern terminus of the Victoria line, Walthamstow Central was in fact originally
        planned to be a through station, with a terminus at Wood Street (Walthamstow), but the plan was
        cut short in the early 1960s and the line terminated here instead. The tunnels still continue 
        beyond the end of the station a full train length, and are used to store trains overnight.
    model_notes: This was done entirely from memory, so the number of tunnels between the platforms and
        other small features may be slightly wrong.
