    description: Bank/Monument is arguably one of the most complex stations on the Underground, with six different
        lines and ten platforms. Even though Bank and Monument stations are
        named separately on the Tube map, they are actually one giant complex, with the Northern and DLR
        platforms actually being somewhere in the middle between the two station entrances.
    model_notes: This is an incredibly difficult station to model, and most of this was done on foot - thus,
        angles and positioning may be slightly wrong. The Bank ticket hall is also rather misrepresented.
