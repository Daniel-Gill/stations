    description: Old Street is one of the few stations in Central London with fully tunneled National
        Rail platforms. Those platforms and tunnels used to be part of the Underground,
        however - first the Metropolitan Line, and then as a branch of the Northern Line.
    model_notes: I'm not quite sure regarding the lengths of the corridor sections here, but the rest
        of the station layout is reasonably accurate.
